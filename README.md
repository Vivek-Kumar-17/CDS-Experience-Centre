# CDS Experience Centre

Chitkara Design Experience Centre is a place for students, parents and teachers to experience the soul of Chitkara University, partake in its endeavors, understand its vision and feel its work ethos. Through its engaging physical space and interactive digital space working in tandem, it strives to create meaningful experiences and support the future designers, parents and educators to start right and to decide their career paths with Chitkara. This Center is built especially for those who are unable to visit the University campus owing to many constraints, for a first hand experience. This Center will also act as a inspirational blue print for educational institutes wanting to build their own brand image.

Experience is something personally encountered, undergone, or lived through and the conscious events that make up an individual life.

Hansjörg Hohr in his paper The concept of experience by John Dewey revisited: conceiving, feeling and “enliving”, explains that Dewey’s concept of experience is proposed in terms of feeling, “enliving” and conceiving.
Feeling refers to the basic mode of experience where action, emotion, cognition and communication constitute an original unity.
Enliving, aesthetic experience, constitutes the lifeworld, as a person-in-world experience. Even though enliving is holistic and relational, a certain distance emerges between action, emotion and cognition which allows contemplation and choice.
Conceiving, on the other hand, refers to the isolating and abstracting understanding of the world with even greater distance between action, emotion and cognition.

Experience is amalgamation of personal emotions and all the senses felt in harmony with one's own personal sense of existence. It encompasses our past and future both tied to our unique encounters.
