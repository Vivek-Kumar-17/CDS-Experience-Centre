# CDS Experience Centre

Chitkara Design Experience Centre is a place for students, parents and teachers to experience the soul of Chitkara University, partake in its endeavors, understand its vision and feel its work ethos. Through its engaging physical space and interactive digital space working in tandem, it strives to create meaningful experiences and support the future designers, parents and educators to start right and to decide their career paths with Chitkara. This Center is built especially for those who are unable to visit the University campus owing to many constraints, for a first hand experience. This Center will also act as a inspirational blue print for educational institutes wanting to build their own brand image.
